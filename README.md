# Mini Project: React Programming - Assignment 3

## Overview

This mini-project is part of Assignment 3 in the React programming course. The objective is to create a web application using React.js for managing currencies. Before starting, ensure that there are some countries added to the "countries" table in the database, as currencies are related to countries and have a foreign key constraint.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Access to the PostgreSQL database server.
- Environment variables set up for the database connection (see the `.env` file).

## Features

- **Add Currency:** Add a new currency by specifying the currency code, country, and conversion rate.
- **Update Currency:** Update the conversion rate of an existing currency.
- **Delete Currency:** Remove a currency from the database.

## Folder Structure

- **src/components:** Contains React components for different sections of the application.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL

## Database Configuration

Ensure that the `.env` file contains the correct database connection details. The database should be named "SamaneRazmi" and have the necessary tables created for currencies and countries.
